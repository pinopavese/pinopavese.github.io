                <p class="text-body">Knowing of the challenges of bringing people to a second floor inside a retail store, especially at a pristine location such as Madison Avenue, the goal for this up and coming designers flagship store was to manipulate the space in such a way that a walk upstairs becomes a destination. In collaboration with the design firm S4Architecture, the concept of this project was that of duplicating. Eliminating two-thirds of the 2nd floor upon entering the store the space becomes a narrow, cathedralesque void with over 20 feet of ceiling height. The entrance proceeds into a compressed and wide nook leading up to a VIP platform floating above the ground floor retail space. Custom bronze and brass elements arranged in a tetris- like manner lead the customer through the luxurious merchandise, always accompanied by natural light that floats the two-story storefront.</p>
