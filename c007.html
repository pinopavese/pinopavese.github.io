                <p class="text-body">Confronted with the challenge of adding program to a mid century design gem outside of San Francisco, the concept had to not only respect the existing structure but also complement it. Originally designed by Donald Knorr and extended by design firm S4Architecture, the new program was defined by a flat roof landscape in contrast to the existing traditional standing seam roof. Large overhands allow for protected exterior decks overlooking the lushes landscape. The core of the project was the new large kitchen space flanked by large glazed sliding panels that when opened up allowed for a natural cross ventilation and maximum transparency where visual connections to the exterior landscape was desired. White oak floors and white walls are carried throughout the house creating a cohesive aesthetic that ties existing and new structures together.</p>
