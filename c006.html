                <p class="text-body">Asked to combine two apartments to one large space that not only houses a magnificent collection of contemporary art but also serves as Pied-a-Terre for this international client and his family, the goal was to merge the two programs of show-casing art and private living in a subtle manner. Inspired by the wall drawings of Sol LeWitt and the polished floors of Chelsea art galleries in New York City, a web of brass stripes laid into a white concrete floor has allowed for a subtle connection. Flowing seamlessly from one room to the other the borders between public and private spaces disappear. In collaboration with design firm S4Architecture, using accents of different materials for the various sleeping quarters allowed to give each family member its individual feel. A black Boffi kitchen and a fire red painted powder room are additional highlights that invite guests and residents to feel inspired at all times.</p>
