                <p class="text-body">Our client had the desire to update the railroad apartments inside a multiple dwelling building into more contemporary “flats”.  The existing apartments had several access points, similar to a SRO (Single Room Occupancy) which we immediately reduced to one main entrance. The clustered interior layout was change to open loft-like spaces that allowed natural light to flooded each room and open up views to the exterior from every angle. A new central core combines wet areas and storage space permitting to allocate larger rooms on the remaining apartment footprint. Two large bedrooms at each end accessible via floor to ceiling pocket doors allow for private retreats and communal living simultaneously. Playing with contrasting finishes on both interior and exterior gives the building an identity along the otherwise anonymous city block.</p>
